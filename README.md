# Afoslt Core

**Afoslt Core** is an open source MVC framework (kinda) acting as a core for websites or Rest API.

This documentation should help you to understand how structure of this ~~piece of shit~~ framework and how it is works.

## Setup

1. Clone Afoslt Core Github repository to your machine: `git clone https://IIpocToTo4Ka/Afoslt` 
2. Using composer and terminal install all dependencies that Afoslt requires: `composer install`
3. Run unit tests to check that everything is fine.

Now you are ready to use Afoslt Core.

**Important:** _This code is not useful and barely can do something. It will be better if you'll use something better(anything is better than this)._
